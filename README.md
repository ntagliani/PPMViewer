# PPM Viewer for the Plain format.

This simple tool displays a ppm image inside a window and keeps checking for it to be changing.
It has been useful with the Rendering In A Weekend tutorial to keep updating the results of the rendered images.

## Limitations

- It only supports the P3 version with one byte depth per color where the pixels are expressed in ASCII characters
- No support for comments
